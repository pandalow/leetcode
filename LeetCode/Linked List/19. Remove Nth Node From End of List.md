# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
 

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

## Solution

```python

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :type n: int
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        dummy = ListNode(0,head)
        slow = dummy
        fast = head
   
        while n > 0:
            fast = fast.next
            n-=1
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next

        return dummy.next
```

## Explanation

We use a dummy node to handle the edge case where the head is the node to be removed. We use two pointers, slow and fast, to find the nth node from the end of the list. We then remove the nth node from the end of the list.
