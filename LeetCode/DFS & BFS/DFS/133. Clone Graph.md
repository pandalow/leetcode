# 133. Clone Graph

Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.

Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.

Each node in the graph contains a value (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
 

Test case format:

For simplicity, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val == 1, the second node with val == 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.

An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.

The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.

 

Example 1:


Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
Example 2:


Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
Example 3:

Input: adjList = []
Output: []
Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.

        seen = {}

        return self.dfs(node, seen)

        
        
    def dfs(self, node, seen):

        if node in seen:
            return seen[node]

        seen[node] = Node(node.val)    

        for n in node.neighbors:
            new.neighbors.append(self.dfs(n,seen))
            
        
        return new
```

solution explain:
- 用hashmap来存储图结构, 对应节点, 不用set, 因为不是单纯的遍历， 而是需要拷贝， 如果有之前的节点。可以直接拿来用
- 然后用递归的方式来获得全新的node，并加入组


使用哈希表 
 来存储原图中被访问过的节点和克隆图中对应节点，键值对为「原图被访问过的节点：克隆图中对应节点」。
从给定节点开始，以深度优先搜索的方式遍历原图。
如果当前节点被访问过，则返回隆图中对应节点。
如果当前节点没有被访问过，则创建一个新的节点，并保存在哈希表中。
遍历当前节点的邻接节点列表，递归调用当前节点的邻接节点，并将其放入克隆图中对应节点。
递归结束，返回克隆节点。
