# 1020. Number of Enclaves

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.

A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.

Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 500
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numEnclaves(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])

        directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]

        def dfs(i,j):

            grid[i][j] = 0
            
            for dx,dy in directions:
                
                di = i+dx
                dj = j+dy

                if 0<=di<m and 0<= dj < n and grid[di][dj] == 1:
                    dfs(di,dj) 

        for i in range(m):
            if grid[i][0] == 1:
                dfs(i,0)
            if grid[i][n-1] == 1:
                dfs(i,n-1)

        for j in range(n):
            if grid[0][j] == 1:
                dfs(0,j)
            if grid[m-1][j] == 1:
                dfs(m-1,j)

        counts = 0

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    counts += 1

        return counts

```

explain：

- 从四条边向内寻找可以联通的cell， 并标注为0， 然后数一下剩下的就是
- 注意限制条件
    -  if 0<=di<m and 0<= dj < n and grid[di][dj] == 1:
    - if grid[0][j] == 1: 这两个条件
