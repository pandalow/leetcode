# 1254. Number of Closed Islands


Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

 

Example 1:



Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Islands in gray are closed because they are completely surrounded by water (group of 1s).
Example 2:



Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,1,0]]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
               [1,0,1,1,1,0,1],
               [1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 100
0 <= grid[i][j] <=1


```python
class Solution(object):
    def closedIsland(self, grid):
        """
        :type grid: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        
        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])

        directions = [(1,0),(-1,0),(0,1),(0,-1)]

        def dfs(i,j):
            grid[i][j] = 1

            for dx, dy in directions:
                di = i+dx
                dj = j+dy

                if 0<=di<m and 0<=dj<n and grid[di][dj] == 0:
                    dfs(di,dj)

        for i in range(m):
            if grid[i][0] == 0:
                dfs(i,0)
            if grid[i][n-1] == 0:
                dfs(i,n-1)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if grid[0][i] == 0:
                dfs(0,i)
            if grid[m-1][i] == 0:
                dfs(m-1,i)
        
        counts = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 0:
                    dfs(i,j)
                    counts+=1
        
        return counts        
```

第一步：从边界出发，把能连通到边界的 0 全部“淹掉”（改成 1）
第二步：遍历整个 grid，遇到 0 就 dfs()，每次找到一块完整的 0 直接 count += 1

核心思路为：替换掉联通所有边界的陆地为水， 然后对中间的陆地进行染色， 染色一次就counts+1
