# 771 Jewels and stones

- Questions
    
    You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
    
    Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.
    
    **Example 1:**
    
    ```
    Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
    Output: 3
    
    ```
    
    **Example 2:**
    
    ```
    Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
    Output: 0
    
    ```
    
    **Constraints:**
    
    - `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
    - `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
    - All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.

My solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels, stones):
        """
        :type jewels: str
        :type stones: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        counts = 0
        for jew in jewels:
            for stone in stones : 
                if jew == stone:
                    counts +=1
        return counts
```

用hash表先存储jewels信息, 再用石头查询可以加快速度, O(M+N)

```python
class Solution(object):
    def numJewelsInStones(self, jewels, stones):
        """
        :type jewels: str
        :type stones: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        jews = {}
        for jew in jewels:
            if jew not in jews:
                jews[jew] = 1
        
        counts = 0
        for stone in stones:
            if stone in jews:
                counts += 1
        return counts
```
