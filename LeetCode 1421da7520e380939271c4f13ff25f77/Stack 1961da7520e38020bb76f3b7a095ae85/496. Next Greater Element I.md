# 496. Next Greater Element I

The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

 ```python
class Solution(object):
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1, nums2):
        """
        :type nums1: List[int]
        :type nums2: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        nums_map = {}
        stack = []
        res = []
        # TODO increasing stack 
        for num in nums2:
            while stack and stack[-1] < num:
                nums_map[stack[-1]] = num
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(num)

        # TODO
        for num in nums1:
            res.append(nums_map.get(num,-1))
        return res
```

Explain:
- 使用单调递增栈，`nums_map[stack[-1]] = num` 这个逻辑重要，实际就是计算当前压入的上一个array数字和当前数字比大小的结果
- 因为是递增， 所以上一个压入的数字比当前数字小，否则一直压入新的数字。
- 这里不关注压入的数字， 而是关注弹出的数字， 因为那个数字正好是上n个压入数字的右边最大值：
- pop（）弹出的为栈顶最小值
